#What it does:
#A list of 5 quiz questions is stored, each with:

#A question text
#Four answer options (A, B, C, D)
#The correct answer key
#The game starts with a welcome message.
#It loops through each question one by one:
#Displays the question and its options.
#Takes the userâ€™s answer input, trims spaces, and converts it to uppercase.
#Compares the answer with the correct one:
#If correct, increases the score and prints "Correct"
#If wrong, shows the correct answer
#After all questions:
#If the user got all right, it says "Excellent! Perfect score"
#If the user got at least half, it says "Good job"
#Otherwise, it says "Keep Practicing"
#Finally, it waits for the user to press enter to exit.
