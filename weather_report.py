#What it does:
#Asks the user to enter a city name.
#Sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather data for that city.
#If the city is found:
#Shows a weather report with:
#Temperature
#Feels like temperature
#Humidity
#Weather condition (e.g., clouds, rain)
#Prints the report on the screen.
#Saves the report in a .txt file with the current date and time in the filename.
#If there's an error (like city not found), it shows the reason.
#Waits for the user to press Enter before closing.
